        After identifying areas for potential improvement, they decided to first focus on the load time of their student summary & session log report. With some work, they were able to get it down to 5-15 seconds and cut the load times by over 50%. <br> <br>

        Acting as a SCRUM Master, I enacted full inspection, adaptation, and transparency. I provided value to the individuals of my team  and their interactions through the emergence of self organizing teams. My highest priority was to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of functional working software.
